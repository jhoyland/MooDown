## Answer

1. \\(P_1 = P_2 = P_3 = P_4 \\)
2. \\(P_1 \gt P_2 \gt P_3 = P_4 \\)
3. \\(P_1 = P_2 \gt P_3 \gt P_4 \\)
4. \\(P_1 = P_2 = P_3 \gt P_4 \\) #100

2. "Circular motion requires centripetal acceleration"

# Rocket sled

A 20kg sled is travelling on a horizontal, frictionless track at 5m/s. A rocket mounted on the sled burns for 3 seconds producing a force of 1000N. What is the velocity of the sled after the 3s? (in m/s)

## Answer

* 155 {1} "Correct"
